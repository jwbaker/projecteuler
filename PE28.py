Problem 28:
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

*21* 22 23 25 *25*
20 *7* 8 *9* 10
19 6 *1*  2 11
18 *5* 4 *3* 12
*17* 16 15 14 *13*

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals of a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

SOLUTION: ???
