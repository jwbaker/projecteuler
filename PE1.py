Problem 1:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

SOLUTION: 233168

total = 0

# This is a pretty simple problem
for num in range(0, 1000):
    if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
        total += num
print(total)
